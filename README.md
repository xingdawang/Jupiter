# Jupiter
Jupiter is a tool for data mining the version histories of software systems, analysis the code to improve software quality

This project can work with existing data or extracting new data from version management system and bug reporting systems. The project will aim to build better bug prediction systems than currently exist.

#Backgroud
Version systems such as CVS, SVN and Git record significant amounts of historical data related to source code changes for an evolving software system. In addition, bug reporting systems like Bugzilla contain records of all changes of bug requests for a software system. These systems can be linked to determine the number of bugs associated with source code units at a particular point in the development history of a project.

A recent systematic literature review on fault prediction performance in software engineering has highlighted the need for more systematic studies in this area. This project would follow the guidelines provided in the systematic literature review to build fault predictoin models using data mining techniques.
